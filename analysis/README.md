Analyses contained in this folder:

01_dada2 - read quality assessment and dada2 ASV calling 
Please note that some of the analysis text in 01_dada2 does not match the actual graphs. I tried a few different methods working with our data before deciding on one to stick with (the current one coded in the document). The data reflected in the graphs is the data used for the rest of the analysis, even though the text does not match. 


02_preprocessing - phyloseq object creation, filtering ASVs

03_biodiversity - rarefaction curves and calculating and plotting Hill Diversity calculations

04_phylogeny - construction of rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees
