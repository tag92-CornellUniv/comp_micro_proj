We will be using this data set to analyze the effect of prescribed fires on the soil microbiome in forests. There are 72 samples, and file sizes range from 20MB-70MB.

Samples were collected from the A, E, and B horizons of forests in Florida falling into one of four groups:
1. An unburned forest
2. A forest 1 year after a prescribed fire/controlled burn
3. A forest 2 years after a prescribed fire/controlled burn
4. A forest 4 years after a prescribed fire/controlled burn

Sequences were amplified with V4 515R and 806R 16s rRNA primers. The exact sequences are not given.  

The accession number for this data is PRJNA847616. There is no associated publication.
